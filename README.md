# <b>abaddon</b> : disord.py bot testing

abaddon is a partialy built discord bot that serves as a testing ground for any bot-based discord stuff that I want to experiment with. He does not represent an active project.


## The future:

abaddon is not, and never was intended to be a finished bot. He is simply used to test discord.py features. The future should include many more abaddon experiments, but it is unlikely the bot will ever be published as a finished product.
